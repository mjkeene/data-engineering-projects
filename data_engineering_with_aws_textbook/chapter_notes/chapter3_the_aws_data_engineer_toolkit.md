<h2>Chapter 3: The AWS Data Engineer's Toolkit</h2>

* Back in 2006, Amazon launched <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b> to offer on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet, essentially creating the cloud computing industry.
* This chapter will introduce a number of these AWS-managed services commonly used for building big data solutions on AWS, and in later chapters, we'll look at how you can architect complex data engineering pipelines using these services. 
* This chapter covers AWS services for:
  * Ingesting data
  * Transforming data
  * Orchestrating big data pipelines
  * Consuming data

<h3>AWS services for ingesting data</h3>

TODO: finish up this chapter later in the week, for now move on to next chapters and revisit highlights to write out notes here.
